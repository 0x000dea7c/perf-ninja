You can decrease the memory traffic of the application if you pack the data more efficiently.
Some of the ways to do that include:

* Eliminate compiler-added padding.
* Use types that require less memory or less precision e.g. (int -> short, double -> float).
* Use bitfields to pack the data even further.
